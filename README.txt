Hello, our team including Tejaswi Mittadoddi, Rhea Rachala, and Saket Bonu were tasked to create a program that allows students at our school (Middleton High School) to calculate their grade point average, by using our school’s grading scale to calculate both weighted and unweighted grade point averages. GPA Pilot is a GPA calculator that is compatible on the Windows operating system and works without any errors. 

This is not a local server because the program fully functions without the internet. But the internet is required in order to view the links due to them being an external url.
